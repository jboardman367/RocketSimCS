# RocketSimCS

## Setup

Build RocketSim, then copy the dll from `RocketSim/out/build/x64-Release` into the
root of this project.

Now you can add this project as a reference in your other projects.

## Updating Bindings
See `cppSharpGen` project in this repo to automatically generate bindings, which
will then need to be manually fixed.
